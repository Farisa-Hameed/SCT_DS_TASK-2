Health Insurance Cost Analysis â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a health insurance dataset to identify key factors influencing insurance costs. By analyzing demographic and behavioral attributes such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, we can uncover patterns in medical expenses and understand their impact on insurance premiums.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps in the Analysis:
âœ… Data Loading & Cleaning â€“ Importing and understanding the dataset structure.
âœ… Statistical Summary â€“ Exploring key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
âœ… Data Visualization â€“ Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for insights.
âœ… Feature Correlation Analysis â€“ Identifying relationships between variables.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations & Insights:
ðŸ“Œ Gender & Region Distribution â€“ Understanding demographics.
ðŸ“Œ Smoker vs. Non-Smoker Costs â€“ Analyzing the impact of smoking on insurance premiums.
ðŸ“Œ Age & BMI Influence â€“ Investigating cost variations based on health metrics.
ðŸ“Œ Correlation Matrix â€“ Identifying relationships between numerical features.

ðŸš€ Business Impact:
This analysis helps insurers, policymakers, and individuals make data-driven decisions, optimize health plans, and improve cost management strategies.
